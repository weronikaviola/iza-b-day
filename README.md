# Iza-b-day
game made with HTML5 and JS6 technology

## TODO

- [x] add points to collect (some environmental positive things...ðŸ˜„)
- [x] add obstacles (maybe logos of some companies polluting waters crawling around...)
- [x] replace the Peach w/ something like Iza's face
- [x] add welcome message before levels
- [x] randomly generate "face" for the badGuy (one of many choices of bad companies etc.)
- [ ] add new levels (3?) ---> MORE!!! (maybe bonus levels with no badGuys but a timer? Too much?
- [ ] what is the prize after she won the game?
- [ ] poster for the game, maybe video advertising it? ðŸ’©
